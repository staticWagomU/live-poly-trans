//! The translation lane: one thread draining a bounded queue of finished
//! utterances through the llama.cpp backend.
//!
//! It is deliberately one-way-ish. The pipeline submits sentences and later
//! collects results; the worker never touches the UI or the recorder. That
//! keeps [`crate::record::SessionRecorder`] single-owner (translations reach
//! the transcript from the same thread that wrote the utterance) and keeps
//! the decode loop free of translation latency: a sentence that takes four
//! seconds costs nothing but its own place in the queue.
